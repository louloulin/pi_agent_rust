# pi-screenshots-picker

A [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/) extension for quickly selecting and attaching screenshots to your prompts. Works on **macOS** and **Linux**. Browse recent screenshots with thumbnail previews, stage multiple images, then type your message - screenshots attach automatically when you send.

## Why

Attaching screenshots during development is tedious. You're constantly:
- Dragging files from Desktop/Finder
- Losing track of which screenshot is which
- Breaking your flow to find the right image

pi-screenshots-picker gives you a visual screenshot browser right in your terminal:

```
/ss
```

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-screenshots-picker
```

## Quick Start

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+S` or type `/ss` to open the picker
2. Navigate with `↑↓`, press `s` or `space` to stage screenshots (✓ appears)
3. Press `Enter` to close the picker
4. Type your message in the prompt
5. Press `Enter` to send - staged images attach automatically

## Commands

### `/ss`

Opens the interactive screenshot picker UI. Browse your recent screenshots with thumbnail previews.

**Keys:**
- **↑↓** - Navigate through screenshots
- **Ctrl+T** - Cycle through source tabs (when multiple sources configured)
- **s / space** - Stage/unstage current screenshot (✓ indicator appears)
- **x** - Clear all staged screenshots
- **o** - Open in Preview.app
- **d** - Delete screenshot from disk
- **Enter** - Close picker
- **Esc** - Cancel

### `/ss-clear`

Clear all staged screenshots without sending.

### `Ctrl+Shift+S`

Keyboard shortcut to open the picker (same as `/ss`).

### `Ctrl+Shift+X`

Keyboard shortcut to clear all staged screenshots (same as `/ss-clear`).

## Features

- **Multiple sources with tabs** - Configure multiple directories/patterns, switch with Ctrl+T
- **Glob pattern support** - Use patterns like `**/*.png` to match files flexibly
- **Thumbnail previews** - See what you're selecting (Kitty/iTerm2/Ghostty/WezTerm)
- **Multi-select** - Stage multiple screenshots, they all attach when you send
- **Relative timestamps** - "2 minutes ago", "yesterday", etc.
- **File sizes** - Know what you're attaching
- **Delete screenshots** - Press `d` to remove unwanted screenshots from disk
- **Staged indicator** - Widget shows `📷 N screenshots staged` below the editor
- **Auto-detection** - Finds your screenshot folder automatically when no config

## Configuration

By default, the extension auto-detects your screenshot location based on your platform.

### Multiple Sources with Tabs

Configure multiple screenshot sources in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. Each source becomes a tab in the picker UI - use **Ctrl+T** to cycle through them:

```json
{
  "pi-screenshots": {
    "sources": [
      "~/Desktop/ss",
      "~/Pictures/Screenshots",
      "/path/to/comfyui/output/**/thumbnail_*.png"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Source Types

**Plain directories** - Scans for screenshot-named PNG files:
```json
"~/Desktop/ss"
```

**Glob patterns** - Matches any image file (PNG, JPG, WebP) matching the pattern:
```json
"/path/to/images/**/*.png"
"/mnt/Store/ComfyUI/Output/**/thumbnail_*.png"
```

Glob patterns support:
- `*` - Match any characters in a filename
- `**` - Match any directories recursively
- `?` - Match a single character
- `[abc]` - Match any character in brackets

### Default Locations (when no config)

**macOS:**
1. System preferences (`defaults read com.apple.screencapture location`)
2. `~/Desktop`

**Linux:**
1. `~/Pictures/Screenshots`
2. `~/Pictures`
3. `~/Screenshots`
4. `~/Desktop`

### Environment Variable

You can also use the `PI_SCREENSHOTS_DIR` environment variable as a fallback:

```bash
export PI_SCREENSHOTS_DIR="/path/to/screenshots"
```

### Priority

1. Config in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (`pi-screenshots.sources`)
2. Environment variable (`PI_SCREENSHOTS_DIR`)
3. Platform default (see above)

## Remote Development

When developing on a remote machine via SSH, you need a way to get screenshots from your local machine to the remote. Use one of these external tools:

### Option 1: SSHFS (Simplest)

Mount a remote folder locally. Screenshots you take locally appear on the remote instantly.

**On your local machine:**

```bash
# Install sshfs
# macOS: brew install macfuse sshfs
# Linux: sudo apt install sshfs

# Create mount point
mkdir -p ~/remote-screenshots

# Mount (replace with your remote)
sshfs user@remote:~/Screenshots ~/remote-screenshots

# Configure macOS to save screenshots there
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/remote-screenshots
killall SystemUIServer
```

**On the remote**, configure pi-screenshots to read from `~/Screenshots`:

```json
{
  "pi-screenshots": {
    "sources": ["~/Screenshots"]
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Syncthing (Most Robust)

[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) provides continuous, bidirectional file sync. Better for unreliable connections.

1. Install Syncthing on both machines
2. Share your local screenshot folder with the remote
3. Configure pi-screenshots to read from the synced folder

### Thumbnail Previews over SSH

To enable thumbnail previews over SSH, add your terminal to the remote's shell profile:

```bash
# Add to remote ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty  # or: kitty, WezTerm, iTerm.app
```

Restart pi after (can't use `!` inside pi).

## Supported Screenshot Formats

The extension recognizes screenshots from various tools:

**macOS:**
- English: `Screenshot ...`
- French: `Capture ...`
- German: `Bildschirmfoto ...`
- Spanish: `Captura ...`
- Italian: `Istantanea ...`
- Dutch: `Scherm...`

**Linux:**
- GNOME Screenshot: `2024-01-30_12-30-45.png`
- Flameshot: `flameshot...`
- KDE Spectacle: `spectacle...`
- Scrot: `scrot...`
- Maim: `maim...`
- Grim (Wayland): `grim...`
- Generic: `screenshot...`

Only PNG files matching these patterns are shown.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux
- Terminal with image support for thumbnails (Kitty, iTerm2, Ghostty, WezTerm)
  - Falls back gracefully on unsupported terminals
