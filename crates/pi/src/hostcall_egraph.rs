//! Equality-saturation rewrite search over hot hostcall execution plans
//! (bd-3ar8v.4.22).
//!
//! [`crate::hostcall_rewrite`] already decides *between* plans: given a
//! baseline and a candidate list it picks the unique cheapest and refuses on a
//! tie. What it never had was anything to produce those candidates — the plans
//! were hand-enumerated. This module is the search that fills that gap, and it
//! deliberately stops at the same boundary: it emits candidates and hands the
//! final say back to `HostcallRewriteEngine::select_plan`, so there is exactly
//! one place in the tree that authorizes a fast path.
//!
//! # Why an e-graph rather than a rewrite list
//!
//! Applying rewrites destructively forces a phase-ordering choice: fusing
//! marshal+validate first can hide the redundant conversion that a different
//! order would have exposed. An e-graph sidesteps that by keeping *all*
//! equivalent forms at once. Each e-class is a set of plans proven
//! interchangeable; rewriting adds a form to a class instead of replacing one,
//! so no rule can destroy the opportunity another rule needed. Extraction then
//! picks the cheapest member of the root class under the measured cost model.
//!
//! # Semantic invariants
//!
//! Every rule in [`rewrite_rules`] preserves observable hostcall behavior:
//! the same opcode executes, against the same policy decision, with the same
//! payload. The rules only remove work that is provably redundant
//! (round-trip conversions) or collapse adjacent stages into an intrinsic that
//! performs both (fusion). Two hard constraints hold throughout:
//!
//! - **Policy is never moved, duplicated, or elided.** Authorization ordering
//!   is a security property, not an optimization surface. Every rewrite is
//!   checked by [`RewriteRule::is_policy_preserving`] *as it is applied*, which
//!   compares the policy stage count, the opcodes, and the subtree beneath each
//!   policy stage. That last comparison is what makes ordering — not merely
//!   presence — preserved: a rewrite turning `dispatch(policy(x))` into
//!   `policy(dispatch(x))` keeps the count and the opcodes, and is rejected
//!   anyway.
//! - **Saturation is bounded.** Rewrites run to a fixpoint or to an explicit
//!   iteration, node, or enumeration budget, whichever comes first, so a
//!   pathological trace cannot stall a hostcall.
//!
//! # Failing closed
//!
//! Ambiguity is treated as a defect, not a coin flip. If the cheapest
//! extraction is not unique, or the budget was exhausted before reaching a
//! fixpoint, the engine reports the baseline with a `fallback_reason` rather
//! than picking arbitrarily. A plan we cannot justify is not a plan we run.
